\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Purpose}
    This Requirement Analysis and Specification Document addresses the description in terms of functional and non-functional requirements of \textit{TrackMe}, a new health monitoring application.
    
    This specification is aimed at giving an explanation both of the problem and of the proposed software-based solution by pointing out different features of the application; in addition, is intended to model and describe the system itself, its requirements, its constraints, its components and how it interacts with the world and the users. Moreover, this specifications also addresses some relevant QoS characteristics that the system should guarantee.
    
    The analysis is focused on requirements elicitation and use cases description through well known standards for specification documents such as \textit{UML} for Use Case, Sequence and Activity Diagrams \cite{rumbaugh2004unified} and \textit{Alloy} for formal analysis \cite{jackson2006software}.
        
    This document is directed and highly recommended to software designers and developers interested in the deployment of the proposed system.
    
    \subsection{Scope and Audience}
        \subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
        \textit{TrackMe} is a company that wants to develop an ease of use health monitoring application which offers different services for both young and old people who needs to keep track of their personal data in order to to keep their health safe.
        
        The system should provide an efficient data acquisition facility which gives the possibility to verified \textit{third-party} signed onto the service to request health status information about subscribed customers. The application may also allow \textit{individual} users to connect \textit{external devices} such as smart-watches or similar, to perform a more detailed data acquisition and monitoring.
        
        In addition, the \textit{third-party} may also provide a personalized and non intrusive SOS service for elderly people that may also request for it.
    
        Moreover, through the \textit{Track4Run} service, \textit{TrackMe} wants to provide to third-parties signed in the application to create a new run, a competition in which other users can either participate as \textit{athletes} or watch as \textit{spectators}. Additionally, this feature may exploits other service functionality for keeping track of athletes progresses and for helping them to prevent major accident happen during the run.
                
        \subsubsection{Description of the proposed system}
        The proposed solution consists of a back-end server application that manages users' registration, login and data and allows to keep everything synchronized between the two front-end applications:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a web-based application to supply to the end user an ease of use interface web interface for \textit{TrackMe};
            \item a mobile application that allows the user to easily access the system from the smartphone.
        \end{itemize}
        
        The application will provide both \textit{"Sign-on"} and \textit{"Sign-in"} pages and will be able to register new users and to check credentials used to login.
        
        To register himself an user must provide an username and a password as well as his/her personal information. To be logged in, the user should send through the login form his credentials which the system will use to authenticate him/her.
        
        \textit{TrackMe} may further yield an interface that allows individual users to connect external devices and a method for acquiring data from it.
        
        The application should also provide to third-parties two possible data request options:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item individual data request: sent directly to the individual if they know an  individual by his/her social security number or fiscal code in Italy;
            \item group data request: access  to  anonymous  data  of  groups  of  individuals, if \textit{TrackMe}  that  approves  them  if  it  is  able  to  properly  anonymize  the  requested  data.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Moreover, the system implements \textit{Data4Help} services to manage individual's personal data and provide them to third-parties who requested for. In addition, there should be an interface both for third-party and individual users registered to \textit{Data4Help} that wants to enable an \textit{Automated-SOS} service. This feature should be able to use users' data to monitor their health status and, when such parameters are below certain thresholds, sends the location of the customer to an ambulance.
        
        Furthermore, the software should provide to users that wants to use \textit{Track4Run} all the facilities they need such as a page for the creation of a new run with all the information (track, date and time) and two different pages to allow both spectators and athletes to watch or enroll to existing run.

    \subsection{Document Overview}
        This initial part of the document is intended to provide both an overview of the problem and an idea of the proposed solution.
        
        Following section is aimed at giving a more detailed description of the proposed system, by meaning of the application point of view. Additionally, it addresses user characteristics, dependencies and constraints.
        
        Third chapter shows a detailed analysis of \textit{TrackMe} in terms both functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Furthermore, takes into account definition of all use cases, their description through UML diagrams and their mapping on requirements.
        
        Endmost section illustrates \textit{Alloy} models including purpose, proof and explanation. In addition, describes worlds obtained by running them.
        
        Further, there is a list of tables and a list of figures representing respectively use cases and diagrams in order to help the reader to understand them and navigate the specification.

    TODO:
    Describe the product's context and origin. Is it the next member of a growing product family, the next version of a mature system, a replacement for an existing application, or an entirely new product? If this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines a component of a larger system, state how this software relates to the overall system and identify major interfaces between the two.  
    
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% pretty sure this is the wrong place for this %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    This section is intended to provide a full description of the proposed system by meaning of \textit{Domains} and \textit{Phenomena} \cite{zave1997four}.
    
    The \textit{Machine Domain} is the set of phenomena that the machine can control: data structures, algorithms, devices and inputs it can get from the world.
    
    In contrast, the \textit{World Domain} is the real-life context in which the \textit{Machine} will be introduced. This is the part of the real-world in which the Machine’s actions will be observed.
    
    The World and the Machine are connected too, because the latter should interact with the first one: this interaction is done through \textit{Shared Domain}, whose phenomena are observable both by the Machine and by the World. Shared Phenomena include events in the real world that the Machine can directly sense and actions in the real world that the Machine can directly cause.

    \subsection{Product Functions}
    \textit{TrackMe} will provide three services: \textit{Data4Help}, \textit{Automated-SOS} and \textit{Track4Run}.
    
    \subsubsection{Data4Help}
    \textit{Data4Help} is the main service: it allows the registration of individuals who by registering consent to provide their personal data to \textit{Track4Me}. Data can be made available to third parties under specific conditions.
    
    \subsubsection{Automated-SOS}
    \textit{Automated-SOS} is built on top of \textit{Data4Help} and provides individuals the ability to subscribe to a third party that has enabled the service. When the individual's health parameters are below a certain threshold an ambulance shall be called to the individual's position under certain time constraints.
    
    \subsubsection{Track4Run}
    \textit{Track4Run} is also built on top of \textit{Data4Help} and allows third parties to create new runs where athletes can participate. Athletes' position can be tracked and it will be sent to all spectators that are watching the run.
    
    \subsection{User Characteristics}
    
        \subsubsection{Data4Help}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Guest:} a person that is visiting \textit{TrackMe}. He can only login or register to the system.
            \item \textbf{User:} a \textit{Guest} that successfully registered to \textit{TrackMe} and logged in to the system. He can be either an \textit{Individual} or a \textit{Third Party.}
            \item \textbf{Individual:} a \textit{User} that agreed that \textit{TrackMe} can collect his personal data. Data acquisition can happen through smartwatches or similar devices.
            \item \textbf{Third Party:} a \textit{User} that can ask an \textit{Individual} to gain access to their personal data. He can also request access to data that belongs to a group of \textit{Individuals}, but the request shall be accepted only if \textit{TrackMe} can guarantee anonymity to the requested data. During a request he can also subscribe to new data that will be received as soon as is it is produced.
        \end{itemize}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        
        \subsubsection{Track4Run Extension}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Organizer:} a \textit{Third Party} that created at least one run. He can create, start or delete a run.
            \item \textbf{Athlete:} an \textit{Individual} that enrolled a run. His position will be sent to all Spectators that joined that run.
            \item \textbf{Spectator:} an \textit{Individual} that joined a run. He can see the position of all Athletes that are competing in the run until the run is finished.

        \subsubsection{Registration}
        \textit{TrackMe} must provide a registration interface for both \textit{individual} and \textit{third-party} users.
        
        A  \textit{individual} must provide his/her SSN (Social Security Number) or FC (Fiscal Code) during the registration phase in order to be uniquely identified by \textit{TrackMe} application. In this way, the user is also accepting terms of service and allows \textit{TrackMe} to acquire his/her personal data.
